Description
This project analyzes road accident severity using a linear regression model. 
The model leverages various factors, including road type, weather conditions, speed limits, time of day, and the presence of traffic signals, to predict the severity of accidents.
By understanding how these factors influence accident severity, the model aims to provide insights that can help improve traffic safety and inform prevention strategies, particularly in underdeveloped countries. 
The predictions can assist authorities in identifying high-risk conditions and making data-driven decisions to enhance road safety.
